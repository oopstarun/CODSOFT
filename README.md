# CODESOFT
Welcome to my Python Programming Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in python programming:
# PROJECT 
1. Toâ€“Do-List
Description: This project focuses on A To-Do List application which is designed to assist users in managing and organizing their tasks effectively. This project involves creating a GUI-based application using Python, enabling users to create, update, and track their to-do lists. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as complete, update existing tasks, and delete tasks that are no longer needed.
2. Calculator
Description: A simple GUI-based calculator that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The user will input two numbers and choose an operation. The calculator will then perform the selected operation and display the result.
3. Password Generator
Description: A Python application that generates strong and random passwords. Users can specify the desired length of the password, and the application will generate a password using a combination of random characters, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
